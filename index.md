# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: May 2025*

## Your Privacy

Your workout data is stored securely on your device and, if iCloud sync is enabled, in your private iCloud account. Only you can access this data unless you share your device or iCloud account with others. Data is never shared with third parties.

## iCloud Sync

If you enable iCloud sync, your workout data is automatically backed up and synced across your Apple devices using your Apple ID. Apple encrypts this data in transit and at rest. The app does not have access to your Apple ID or password.

## HealthKit

With your permission, the app can write workout data to the Health app. No data is read from HealthKit, and no data is shared with third parties. You can revoke HealthKit access at any time in the Health app.

## Data Retention

Your workout data is stored locally on your device and in your iCloud account. You can delete your data at any time by deleting the app or removing it from iCloud. When you delete the app, all local data is removed from your device.

## Analytics & Tracking

This app does not collect analytics, track your activity, or use advertising identifiers. We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

This app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the 'Last updated' date.
